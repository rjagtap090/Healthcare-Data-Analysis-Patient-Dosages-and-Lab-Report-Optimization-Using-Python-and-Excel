# Project Title: Healthcare Data Analysis and Optimization of Patient Dosages and Lab Reports Using Python and Excel

## Project Overview
This project delves into the analysis of healthcare data, specifically focusing on patient dosages and lab reports, using a combination of Python and Excel. The project aims to uncover patterns in medication usage, analyze patient switching behavior, and perform financial modeling to inform strategic decision-making within a healthcare setting.

## Key Features
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregates and summarizes patient dosage and lab report data across different periods using Python and Excel, providing insights into healthcare trends.
- **Patient Analysis**: Tracks and analyzes patient data over time with Python scripts, while Excel calculations reveal patterns in medication dosage and lab results.
- **Break-Even Analysis**: Python and Excel are employed to determine the break-even price per unit of medication, considering patient transitions and dosage changes.
- **Optimization Models**: Applies advanced optimization techniques through Excel's Solver and Python libraries to manage healthcare inventory, determine reorder points, and recommend cost-effective strategies.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Utilized for healthcare data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for aggregating healthcare data, performing statistical analysis, and conducting financial modeling.
- **Excel Solver**: Applied for optimization tasks, including linear programming and sensitivity analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Python libraries used for handling healthcare datasets and performing numerical calculations.

## Key Insights
- **Patient Switching Behavior**: Python scripts provide detailed analysis of patient transitions between medications, alongside calculations of average time on each medication.
- **Dosage and Lab Report Analysis**: Combined Python and Excel methods yield accurate monthly dosage calculations and lab report summaries, offering insights into patient health trends.
- **Cost Optimization**: The break-even pricing model, developed using Python and Excel, supports strategic decisions on medication pricing and healthcare cost management.

## Results
- **Optimized Healthcare Inventory Management**: Implemented EOQ and Quantity Discount Models through Python and Excel to reduce healthcare inventory costs while maintaining service levels.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Data-driven insights enable strategic decision-making regarding medication pricing, patient dosages, and lab report analysis.

## How to Use
1. **Data Preparation**: Use Python scripts to preprocess healthcare data, ensuring it is correctly formatted for further analysis in Excel.
2. **Analysis Execution**: Run Python scripts and follow the steps in the Excel file to conduct a thorough analysis of patient dosages and lab reports.
3. **Interpretation**: Review the generated results and visualizations to extract actionable healthcare insights from the data.

## Future Work
- **Advanced Statistical Modeling in Healthcare**: Integrate more sophisticated Python libraries for deeper statistical analysis of healthcare data.
- **Automation**: Develop Python scripts to automate the update and real-time analysis of healthcare data.

# Project Title: Healthcare Data Analysis: Patient Dosages and Lab Report Optimization Using Python and Excel

## Project Overview
This project centers around analyzing healthcare data, specifically focusing on patient dosages and lab reports, using Python and Excel. The goal is to identify patterns in medication usage, understand patient switching behaviors, and optimize dosages to improve healthcare outcomes. The project integrates both Python scripting and Excel functionalities to perform advanced data analysis and financial modeling.

## Key Features
- **Total Units Utilization**: Calculated the total units of medication utilized each month, broken down by specific medications, using Python for data processing and Excel for final visualization.
- **Patient Count Analysis**: Monthly tracking of the number of patients on specific medications, using Python to group data by month and medication, followed by detailed analysis in Excel.
- **Average Dosage Calculation**: Computed the average monthly dose per patient, integrating data from both Python and Excel to ensure accurate and comprehensive insights.
- **Patient Switching Behavior**: Analyzed the switching patterns of patients from one medication to another, identifying trends and optimizing treatment plans using Python for data processing and Excel for final tabulation.
- **Breakeven Price Analysis**: Conducted a financial analysis to determine the breakeven price for new medications, factoring in dosage variations and patient switching data.
- **Lab Report Analysis**: Assessed LAB B values in correlation with patient dosages, leveraging Python for data manipulation and Excel for in-depth analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Employed for data manipulation, aggregation, and initial analysis.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for final data processing, visualization, and financial modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Python libraries utilized for efficient data handling and numerical calculations.
- **Excel Solver**: Applied for optimization tasks such as calculating optimal dosages and pricing models.
